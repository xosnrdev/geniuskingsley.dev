## Editor

<ul>
  <li>
    My editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a giant pile of
    extensions. Feel free to checkout my favourite [VSCode
    Extensions](https://efficacious-mammal-600.notion.site/Chidera-s-VSCode-Extensions-74cfff9a3b71434889d486cac4ed44c0?pvs=4).
  </li>
  <li>
    I am currently using [Shades of
    Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple) as my
    theme.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) is my font of choice mainly
    because of the cursiveness.
  </li>
</ul>

## Terminal

<ul>
  <li>
    [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) just like any package manager homebrew serves for installation of
    node packages and files with just a simple command.
  </li>
  <li>
    [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is my favourite for terminal
    productivity, customization and flexibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    All terminals use [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) as fonts
    because cursiveness all the way.
  </li>
</ul>

## Desktop Apps

<ul>
  <li>[Chrome](https://chrome.com/) is my main browser for both browsing and development.</li>
  <li>[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API development and testing.</li>
  <li>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) mainly for inspecting designs.</li>
  <li>[Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for messaging or calls.</li>
  <li>[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for issue tracking and notes.</li>

</ul>
