I’m a Software developer who really enjoys messing around with React and Next.js. I've got a good grip on the MERN stack too with a knack of problem-solving, making things work, and then tweaking them to make them even better. It's pretty cool to see how technologies evolve, and I make sure to keep up so I don't miss out on the fun!

If you're curious, you can take a peek at my portfolio to see what I've been up to And oh, don't miss out on my music playlist—it's quite the collection! If you feel like we could create some magic together, just hit me up. I'm all ears. Let's chat if you think we could make something cool together!
