## Editor

- My editor of choice is Visual Studio Code with a giant pile of extensions. Feel free to checkout my favourite VSCode Extensions.
- I am currently using Monokai Pro as my theme.
- Monaco font is my font of choice mainly because of the cursiveness.

## Terminal

- Homebrew just like any package manager homebrew serves for installation of node packages and files with just a simple command.
- iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh is my favourite for terminal productivity, customization and flexibility.
- All terminals use Cascadia Code as fonts because cursiveness all the way.

## Apps

- Chrome is my main browser for both browsing and development.
- Postman for API development and testing.
- Figma mainly for inspecting designs.
- Slack and Discord for messaging or calls.
- Linear for issue tracking and project management.
- Spotify for music.

## Desk Setup

I'm making a list of setup I use and gadgets I plan to purchase.
